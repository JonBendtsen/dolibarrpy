2024-04-20 Jon Bendtsen decides to fork Mark Meadows seamingly dead project
	from https://gitlab.com/mvmdata/dolibarr. Renamed to dolibarrpy such
	that JonB can also release it at PyPi once he has extended it with
	the needed functionality. Github was choosen as a new home because
	JonB already has an account there and Dolibarr ERP & CRM itself is
	already hosted at https://github.com/Dolibarr
